### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- I've been dabbling in C++ for many years, but it's been an uphill battle.
- I'm not the programming sort of person.
- Fun things like reading and sitting still are challenges for me.
- Despite myself, I enjoy learning and programming.
- I'm looking for a community that can be patient and understanding.
- It is my experience that the majority of people are NOT patient or understanding.
- I am prepared to be proven wrong, though doubtful.
